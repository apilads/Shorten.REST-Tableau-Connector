# Shorten.REST Tableau Web Data Connector
Shorten.REST Tableau Connector is a Web Data connector that allows Shorten.REST users to pipe their data from Shorten.REST to Tableau in order to visualize & study their data. By using our first party connector you will be able to automatically import your data into Tableau.

### How the Shorten.REST Tableau connector works
The connector works as an intermediate layer between Shorten.REST and Tableau. It will verify your account via your API KEY and then fetch all clicks in your account storing them on Tableau. After your click data is stored in Tableau you will be able to easily manipulate, visualize, and analyze your data.

### Data Refreshes
Shorten.REST connector supports two types of data refreshes, first one is Full refresh which will refresh the entire data extract stored in tableau. The second type is incremental refresh: the connector will pull and retrieve new records from where you left off with the data in tableau which can greatly reduce the time required to download the data.
